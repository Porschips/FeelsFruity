        <h3>About</h3>
        <div class="ArticleImageLeft"><img src="GrapeImages/Grapes.jpg" alt="Image of fresh Grapes"></div>
        <p>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Theyâ€™re high in vitamin C and contain compounds that keep your heart healthy.
            They're also used for making products such as wine and raisins which you can see almost everywhere in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. 
            "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. 
            Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. 
            Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. 
            Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid.

            Raw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat (table). 
            A 100-gram (3+1/2-ounce) reference amount of raw grapes supplies 288 kilojoules (69 kilocalories) of food energy and a moderate amount of vitamin K (14% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content.

        <h3>Products made from grapes</h3>

                <div class="ArticleImageLeft"><img src="GrapeImages/GrapeWine.jpg" alt="Grape Wine"></div>
                Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. 
                Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. 
                Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. 
                These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. 
                Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine.

                <div class="ArticleImageRight"><img src="GrapeImages/GrapeRaisins.jpg" alt="Grape Raisins"></div>
                A raisin is a dried grape. Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. 
                In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, the word raisin is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape, 
                with sultana being a golden-colored dried grape, and currant being a dried small Black Corinth seedless grape.
