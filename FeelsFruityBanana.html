        <div class="ArticleImageLeft"><img src="BananaImages/Bananas.jpg" alt="Image of fresh Bananas"></div>
        <p> 
            Banana is the most popular fresh fruit in all over the world and its name comes from the Arabic word 'banan', which means finger.
            Bananas are rich source carbohydrates and potassium. They are the first choice by athletics due to its high energy giving capability. 
            The funny thing to notice about banana is its shape (like an arc) which makes its appearance appealing. And why not, they are the favorite fruit of monkeys!

            They come in colors say, green, yellow, purple and red. Most of the varieties are perennial (grown throughout the year). 
            They are native to tropical southeast asis, but now are grown almost in all places. 
            They are known as either "Dessert" bananas (when fully ripe) or cooking bananas

            Bananas are great super food which provides us with energy, make us feel full and provide our body with essential nutrients and high amount of fiber. 
            The scientific name of banana is Masa acuminata and Masa balbisiana.
            It is natural that we always mistake a banana for a plantain. 
            Plantains are a member of the banana family. They are bigger in size and bright green. 
            When compared to bananas plantains are thick skinned. While banana can be eaten raw plantains are not usually eaten raw because of its starch content. 
            They serve an important role in many traditional diets. When used in cooking they are treated more like a vegetable than a fruit. 
            Plantain contains less sugar and so they usually cooked or processed before being eaten. When it is little mature they can be fried, boiled, baked, micro-waved etc. 
            The chips made out of green plantains are one of the favorite dishes in the Southwestern Indian state of Kerala.
